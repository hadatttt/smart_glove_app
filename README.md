# Smart Glove App

## Project Overview
The **Smart Glove App** is an innovative application designed to interpret hand gestures captured by a smart glove device. The app translates these gestures into meaningful actions, such as text output or device control, enabling seamless interaction for users, especially in assistive technology or human-computer interaction scenarios.

## Key Features
- **Real-Time Gesture Recognition**: Accurately detects and interprets hand gestures in real time.
- **Wireless Connectivity**: Supports Bluetooth or Wi-Fi for data transmission between the glove and the app.
- **Customizable Actions**: Allows users to map specific gestures to commands or text output.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Intuitive design for easy navigation and usage.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Works on Android and iOS devices (if applicable).
